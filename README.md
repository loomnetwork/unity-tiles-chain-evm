# Unity Tiles Chain EVM  Sample

A basic example showcasing a simple Unity game interacting with an EVM-based Loom DappChain, using [Loom Unity SDK](https://github.com/loomnetwork/unity3d-sdk).

It uses `Truffle` and [Loom Truffle Provider](https://github.com/loomnetwork/loom-truffle-provider) for deployment and contract testing.

Game instructions
----

Use the mouse cursor to click on the black canvas area to create colored tiles, each new player will have a different color the canvas which is shared amongst all players.

Development
----

## 1. Run your own DappChain

Please consult the [Loom SDK docs](https://loomx.io/developers/en/basic-install-all.html) for further instructions on running your own DappChain.

## 2. Download the example project (Tiles Chain EVM)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/loomnetwork/unity-tiles-chain-evm
```

## 3. Start the DappChain local node

Open a console.

```bash
cd unity-tiles-chain-evm
cd DAppChain

# Configure and Run
./start-chain.sh
```

## 4. Build and Deploy with Truffle

> Before running the following steps, make sure that Node.js v10 (recommended v10.15.3) is installed on your computer. To check out if Node.js is installed on your computer, fire up a terminal, and enter `node -v`.

Open another console.

```bash
cd unity-tiles-chain-evm
cd TruffleProject

# Restore packages
npm install

# Build and copy contract ABI into Unity project
npm run build

# Deploy to local node
npm run deploy
```

After deployment, take note of the address of the deployed contract.

## 5. Build the Unity client

1. Open the Unity project located in `UnityClient`.
2. Open the `LoomTilesChainEvm` scene.
3. Select the `Controller` object and copy the deployed contract address into the `ContractAddressHex` field.
4. Run the scene to check if everything works, and build the project.
